#+TODO: TODO UNFINISHED WORKING | DONE

* DONE 146
- Supposed to be solved with cpp stl, perhaps a c implementation of next_permutation will be more exciting?
* DONE 429
- Word transformation: looks like a graph problem
  - Appears under 'easy BFS' 
- Needs to be revisited
* UNFINISHED 12532
- On uhunt this problem is put under 'tree-related structures', but not sure how a tree might be useful in this case
  - A segment tree perhaps?
- Attempting a (naive) linear array first to see if it works (half expecting it to fail on time limit)
  - Failed on TLE
* TODO 924
- Involves finding the depth with maximum number of nodes from a given node
- BFS with keeping track of queue sizes for each depth
