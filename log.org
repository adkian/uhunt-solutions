#+TODO: TODO UNFINISHED WORKING | DONE

* DONE 146
- Supposed to be solved with cpp stl, perhaps a c implementation of next_permutation will be more exciting?
* UNFINISHED 429
- Word transformation: looks like a graph problem
- Needs to be revisited
* WORKING 12532
- On uhunt this problem is put under a 'tree-related structures', but not sure how a tree might be useful in this case
  - Attempting a (naive) linear array first to see if it works (half expecting it to fail on time limit)
