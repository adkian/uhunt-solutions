#+TODO: TODO UNFINISHED WORKING | DONE

* DONE 146
- Supposed to be solved with cpp stl, perhaps a c implementation of next_permutation will be more exciting?
* DONE 429
- Word transformation: looks like a graph problem
  - Appears under 'easy BFS' 
- Needs to be revisited
* DONE 924
- Involves finding the depth with maximum number of nodes from a given node
- BFS with keeping track of queue sizes for each depth
* UNFINISHED 12532
- On uhunt this problem is put under 'tree-related structures', but not sure how a tree might be useful in this case
  - A segment tree perhaps?
- Attempting a (naive) linear array first to see if it works (half expecting it to fail on time limit)
  - Failed on TLE
* TODO 1203
- Min priority queue with decrease-key
* TODO 10954
- Min priority queue, popping each element and adding it 
- Adding up costs of a simple array would not work since adition of sums would not necessarily be smallest (adding other sums to additions could be shortest)
* TODO 11995
- Would need all STL DS??
* TODO new probs
** TODO 100235
- Sieve of eratothenes
** TODO 10140
- 
** TODO 11264
- greedy algorithm, ch 16
